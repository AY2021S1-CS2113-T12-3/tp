### Enhancements implemented

* I implemented the `help` and `exit` commands at the very beginning of the project. 

* I implemented the file storage functionality, that allows the application to save the user's progress/data. 

* Near the end, I implemented the command prompt to show the user's current selection/location in the application
. This was in response to [this issue](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-3/tp/issues/175) from the PE Dry Run. 

* I helped implement, troubleshoot, and refactor various other features. 

### Contributions to User Guide

* I wrote the introduction and part of the setup guide. 

* I wrote the feature guides for `help` and `exit`

* I wrote the section about editing the save file. 

### Contributions to Developer Guide

### Contributions to team-based tasks

* I set up the organisation and repository for the team on GitHub. 

* I usually managed the issue tracker, setting up issues/milestones, labels etc. 

* I refactored the code a few times to make sure it looked like one person had written all of it and to improve the
 use of OOP principles.
